# App Developer Guidelines

## Plugin Isolation

- Never import directly from another plugin's source code
- Use **spec packages** for extension point type definitions
- Cross-plugin communication flows through ExtensionPoint and Extension components only

## Naming Conventions

- **Aggregates:** singular nouns (Product, Order, Customer)
- **Read models / views:** plural nouns (Products, Orders, Customers)
- **Commands:** imperative (Add, UpdateName, PlaceOrder)
- **Events:** past tense (Added, NameUpdated, OrderPlaced)
- **Extension points:** dotted names ("Catalog.Products", "Ordering.Orders")
- **Plugin namespaces:** `{Plugin}Plugin` (CatalogPlugin)
- **Spec namespaces:** `{Plugin}Spec` (CatalogSpec)

## Required Annotations

- `@schema` on all serializable types (command, event, error, state)
- `@s.matches(DcbTag.string)` on entity ID fields in DCB types (on the type, not the field name)
- `let moduleUrl: string = %raw(\`import.meta.url\`)` on all spec files

## Idempotency

Commands that would produce no state change should return `Ok([])`, not an error. This is important because commands may be retried due to at-least-once delivery.

## Architecture Decision

Before adding a new entity, evaluate against `docs/guides/aggregate-vs-dcb-decision-guide.md`. Cross-entity consistency needs → DCB. Self-contained lifecycle → Aggregate.
